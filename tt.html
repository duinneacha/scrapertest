								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.digitalbridge.com/">DigitalBridge</a>, the Manchester, U.K.-based startup using technology to help solve the &#8220;imagination gap&#8221; when planning home renovations, has picked up £3 million in new backing.</p>
<p>The round is led by Maven Capital Partners via two funds it manages: £1.5 million from Maven’s Venture Capital Trusts (VCTs) and £1.5 million from the NPIF Maven Equity Finance, a regional development fund managed by Maven as part of the U.K. government&#8217;s Northern Powerhouse Investment Fund.</p>
<p>Working with Kingfisher Plc (owners of B&amp;Q and Castorama) for the last couple of years, DigitalBridge has pivoted from its original <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/01/digitalbridge/">AR-based home decor planning app</a> to a new product it&#8217;s calling a &#8216;guided design tool&#8217; for kitchens and bathrooms. That&#8217;s because, DigitalBridge founder David Levine tells me, home decor visualisation is only a nice-to-have whereas it’s a &#8220;must-have&#8221; for bathrooms and kitchens.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bathrooms and kitchens are much more complex rooms governed by complex design rules,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;We felt there was a big gap for a guided design tool which actively guides consumers through the entire journey of designing, visualising and buying whilst simplifying the inherent complexity of these rooms&#8221;.</p>
<p>There was, perhaps, another factor at play, too: the creation of AR development kits by Apple and Google have made it &#8220;really simple&#8221; for retailers to build their own home decor and furniture AR solutions, as well as seeing new competitors enter the space.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unlike most tools on the market today, DigitalBridge is utterly focused on the consumer and obsessed with creating simple and compelling experiences that enable that consumer to build their dream bathroom or kitchen irrespective of their design experience,&#8221; adds Levine. &#8220;Crucially, our core skillsets of AI and computer vision are absolutely pivotal to reducing that complexity&#8221;.</p>
<p><img title="TechCrunch_01_3dViewer"  src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/TechCrunch_01_3dViewer.jpg?w=680" alt="TechCrunch 01 3dViewer" width="680" height="441" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1852000" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/TechCrunch_01_3dViewer.jpg 2268w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/TechCrunch_01_3dViewer.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/TechCrunch_01_3dViewer.jpg?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/TechCrunch_01_3dViewer.jpg?resize=768,498 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/TechCrunch_01_3dViewer.jpg?resize=680,441 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/TechCrunch_01_3dViewer.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>The DigitalBridge solution resides on a retailer&#8217;s website or app &#8212; it is already live with B&amp;Q in the U.K. &#8212; and guides you through the entire process of creating your new bathroom or kitchen. The the draw for retailers is that by enabling customers to easily design and visualise their new bathroom or kitchen, DigitalBridge can reduce sales cycles, increase conversion rates and average basket sizes, and &#8220;drive more engaged customers into store&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;By using our technology, consumers are now able to visit the B&amp;Q website and design the dream bathroom that will work for them, their family and budget, all without the need for professional assistance,&#8221; explains Levine. &#8220;Within minutes, they are guided through the process of entering their floor plan, designing the perfect bathroom and bringing it to life in immersive 3D. Once they’re happy with the design, they can buy directly online or go into a store to complete the purchase&#8221;.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, with regards to today&#8217;s newly disclosed funding round, Jeremy Thompson, Investment Director at Maven, says that DigitalBridge has developed a market-leading AI product which solves a genuine problem for retailers&#8221; by helping them engage with customers online. &#8220;We are genuinely excited to work with them and support their next stage of growth, as they look to accelerate deployment of the existing product, develop new products and enter new markets, including the U.S.,&#8221; he adds.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.wind.co/">Wind Mobility</a>, the Berlin and Barcelona-based micro-mobility startup that operates e-scooter rentals in Europe, Israel and Asia, is disclosing $50 million in Series A funding. The new round is backed by existing investors. The company last raised $22 million in funding eight months ago from Chinese Source Code Capital and Europe&#8217;s HV Holtzbrinck Ventures, after it pivoted away from bike rentals to focus on e-scooters.</p>
<p>Coinciding with the new funding, Wind is unveiling its &#8220;third generation&#8221; e-scooters, which it says have been designed &#8220;from the ground up&#8221; for micro-mobility sharing. Eight months in development, the new hardware claims to be significantly more durable and best-in-class for battery life with the ability to drive 65-80km between charges.</p>
<p>The battery is hot swappable, too, meaning that it should be more efficient to run the Wind e-scooter service. That&#8217;s because not only can more scooters remain in circulation at any given time, potentially increasing revenue per scooter, but there&#8217;s a reduction in the cost of collecting dead batteries for re-charging as they are de-coupled from the scooter itself.</p>
<p>Wind also claims its new scooter has the highest waterproofing with IP67 standard, and that its increased durability should see it last over 12 months when used in the tough sharing environment. That in turn puts the startup on a better unit economic footing since flimsy hardware that needs to be replaced frequently has been a fiscal drag for e-scooter companies using off-the-shelf e-scooters designed primarily for single ownership and not for commercial use.</p>
<p>In the last few months a number of other micro-mobility companies have announced upgrades to their hardware, including European competitors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/on-your-new-scooter/">Voi</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/05/tier-hardware/">Tier</a>, although Wind Mobility co-founder and CEO Eric Wang has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/21/wind-mobility/">long talked up the importance of hardware</a> as a differentiator, something he echoed again in a call late last week.</p>
<p>Specifically, Wang argued that it is still &#8220;Day One&#8221; in the e-scooter rental race and even though Wind hasn&#8217;t been as aggressive in its roll out and has deployed less scooters than Lime, Voi and Tier in Europe, he says there is still everything to play for. He said it was a conscious decision not to put too many scooters on the streets until the hardware was good enough to set the company on a path to profitability. Even with the 3rd generation scooter being deployed immediately, the company plans to stagger the launch so that it can gather sufficient data on how the new hardware is performing before hitting the accelerator so to speak.</p>
<p>The early signs look promising, however (in a video Wang sent me via WhatsApp the new Wind scooter survives being plunged into a pond and can be seen driving off after retrival from the water), although the Wind CEO cautions other companies and industry commentators not to underestimate how difficult hardware is. He argues that the detailed design decisions that Wind has made and the resulting improvements aren&#8217;t easily replicated any time soon and that there are &#8220;no shortcuts&#8221; in hardware. This has seen Wind set up its own R&amp;D center in China in order to work as closely with the supply chain as possible.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;m told Wind now offers its services in 20 plus cities including operations in Germany, France, Spain, Israel, Austria, Portugal, Demark, Korea and Japan. The company currently employs over 120 people worldwide.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla CEO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/elon-musk" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="elon-musk">Elon Musk <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said the company will &#8220;most likely&#8221; begin upgrading older electric vehicles with its new custom chip later this year — a lofty task that will involve retrofitting hundreds of thousands of Model S, X and 3s.</p>
<p>Musk tweeted Sunday night that the upgrades will begin most likely at the end of the fourth quarter.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">End of Q4, most likely</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1148072753867546624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Musk didn&#8217;t provide other details. He has previously said the upgrade would be free for owners who purchased the full self-driving feature, a software package that costs $6,000.</p>
<p>Tesla offers two different advanced driver assistance packages to customers: Autopilot and Full Self-Driving or FSD. Autopilot is ADAS that offers a combination of adaptive cruise control and lane steering and is now a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/13/tesla-is-raising-the-price-on-the-future/">standard feature on new cars</a>. FSD includes Summon as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/26/tesla-is-rolling-out-its-navigate-on-autopilot-feature/">Navigate on Autopilot</a>, an active guidance system that navigates a car from a highway on-ramp to off-ramp, including interchanges and making lane changes.</p>
<p>While Tesla charges for the FSD software package, the vehicles are not fully autonomous. Musk has promised that the advanced driver assistance capabilities on Tesla vehicles will continue to improve until eventually reaching that full automation high-water mark.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Anyone who purchased full self-driving will get FSD computer upgrade for free. This is the only change between Autopilot HW2.5 &amp; HW3. Going forward “HW3” will just be called FSD Computer, which is accurate. No change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. This is v important. <a href="https://t.co/lICMpT7xnX">https://t.co/lICMpT7xnX</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1111762533520531456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/22/teslas-computer-is-now-in-all-new-cars-and-a-next-gen-chip-is-already-halfway-done/">custom chip</a> unveiled in April has been couched as a necessary hardware upgrade to reach that goal. Since March, new Model X and S vehicles have come equipped with the chip. The Model 3 followed a month later.</p>
<p>The custom chip was a milestone for the company. However, it still faces the considerable challenge of upgrading thousands of so-called &#8220;Hardware 2&#8221; vehicles, not to mention the continuous development of the software.</p>
<p>Tesla started producing electric vehicles with a more robust suite of sensors, radar, and cameras — called Hardware 2— in October 2016 under the premise and the promise that it had the hardware needed to eventually drive autonomously without human intervention. At that time, the company also began selling the upgraded full self-driving package that Musk said would eventually reach that ambitious target.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.soldo.com/">Soldo</a>, the U.K. fintech that offers a multi-user spending account for businesses, has closed $61 million in Series B funding.</p>
<p>Leading the round is Battery Ventures and Dawn Capital, with participation from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/20/soldo-a-london-fintech-startup-that-offers-a-multi-user-spending-account-raises-11m-led-by-accel/">previous backers</a> Accel and Connect Ventures. In addition, a small portion is debt financing from Silicon Valley Bank. It brings total raised by the London-based startup to $82 million.</p>
<p>Founded by Carlo Gualandri, who previously helped create Italy’s first online bank, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/soldo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="soldo">Soldo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> offers a multi-user spending account for businesses of all sizes &#8212; from SMEs to much larger enterprises &#8212; that need to deploy and manage expenses across an entire organisation.</p>
<p>It enables departmental and employee spending to be managed in real time by combining a Soldo account, central dashboard, apps for iOS and Android and virtual wallets or physical “pre-paid” MasterCards that can be handed out to employees, departments and even external consultants or contractors.</p>
<p>In addition, Soldo offers granular spending controls that are at the heart of its tech stack. This allows for different expense criteria for each employee, contractor or spending department, with permissions set and all spending trackable centrally. It also lets users capture receipt data, while the whole system integrates with commonly used business accounting packages such as Xero, Quickbooks, Concur, Expensify, NetSuite, Zucchetti and SAP</p>
<p>Asked what the biggest challenge for Soldo has been over the last 12 months, Gualandri says &#8220;educating the market,&#8221; something that he doesn&#8217;t see changing any time soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you don&#8217;t know that a solution exists, you don&#8217;t even call it a &#8220;problem&#8221; but you consider it just a &#8216;fact of life&#8217;,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Spend management is a new category that replaces many old and outdated processes. [It] allows companies to distribute access to money with control, enabling flatter and more agile organisations. It will take time for the market to fully realise its transformational power&#8221;.</p>
<p>To that end, Gualandri says the most gratifying thing over the last year has been the results achieved within the companies that have started adopting Soldo. &#8220;We have been recognised by thousands of companies from small to very large as an innovative and reliable provider of financial services,&#8221; he tells me. &#8220;No small achievement in the traditionally more conservative world of business&#8221;.</p>
<p>Soldo isn&#8217;t profitable yet, but Gualandri says it could be within one or two years if that was the goal. However, this would mean choosing &#8220;slower, more organic growth&#8221; and given there is a very large market in front of Soldo it &#8220;would not be the right choice&#8221;. The majority of companies in Europe are still using &#8220;reimbursable expenses, spreadsheets and manual processes to manage the expense management cycle&#8221; and Soldo&#8217;s competition largely remains the status quo way of doing things (although Denmark&#8217;s Pleo, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/pleo-series-b/">operates in a similar space</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;We are a company with a fixed cost base and good unit economics so the break-even point is dependent on how much we invest and grow the fixed cost base (because most of our investment is people) and the volume of customers and spend managed by our system,&#8221; he says. &#8220;So by deciding to invest in product and sales we are in effect targeting a larger revenue and profit base but later on&#8221;.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Soldo&#8217;s Series B round will be used to further grow in the U.K., where it claims a &#8220;leadership position,&#8221; and in Italy and Ireland. The company also plans to enter new European markets and double its workforce over the next 12 months. Gualandri says Soldo will continue to invest in its product, too, in order to tackle additional spend management &#8220;pain points&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Travel expenses is the most common need but procurement, purchasing goods and services, subscriptions, mobility expenses, employees benefits are all areas that can be innovated and are an expression of the concept of company spend management,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Soldo recently secured an e-money licence from Ireland’s central bank in addition to the license it holds in the U.K. so that it can continue trading within the European single market post-Brexit and in the event of &#8220;no-deal&#8221;. “It’s crazy to think we’ve been forced to work for a year and a half on a hugely complex project, mostly duplicating something that we had already, to prepare our business for something that may or may not happen,” Gualandri <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/05/fintexit/">told TechCrunch at the time</a> of announcing its newly acquired Irish license.</p>

<p>Fish is a hugely important source of protein as we face a growing population and the challenges of food insecurity. But supplying fish sustainably, without depleting natural resources and harming the aquatic environment, is a continuous challenge. Fish is contaminated with plastics, mercury and antibiotics. And fish farming isn’t doing much to tackle food insecurity, as it isn’t <a href="https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/research-news/2013-11-28-the-poor-mans-fish.html" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/research-news/2013-11-28-the-poor-mans-fish.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1562612996086000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHvI2pAry_-hTNXvEqO0piwiMVeXQ">reaching the places where it’s most needed</a>.</p>
<p>There is also a long and ongoing debate about fish welfare, and whether fish species are sentient and can feel pain when they’re fished and killed. But research is putting this debate to rest and showing that a number of species demonstrate having long-term memory, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/fish-sentient-animals-friends-positive-emotions-study-study-source-ethics-eating-pescaterians-vegans-a7660756.html" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/fish-sentient-animals-friends-positive-emotions-study-study-source-ethics-eating-pescaterians-vegans-a7660756.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1562612996086000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG3AvhirLamcleKgH0wyDMcaonUaQ">social bonding</a> and parenting skills, use tools, learn traditions and cooperate with other species.

<p>But while fish farms in some countries must follow humane slaughter guidelines, there are no standards for wild fishing. And these guidelines are a far cry from their name. The traditional method for killing farmed fish is letting them asphyxiate in air or on ice, which is a prolonged and distressing processes, and is sometimes followed by a stun. The fish are often crowded into one small space, living in poor conditions and often starving. Overcrowded fish are more prone to disease, stress and aggression, which can cause them to lash out at each other and cause injuries. The pens can be a breeding ground for sea lice and disease, and parasites. And there are so man fish subject to this that we’ve lost count. Estimates suggest up to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/18/horrific-footage-reveals-fish-suffocating-to-death-on-industrial-farms-in-italy" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/18/horrific-footage-reveals-fish-suffocating-to-death-on-industrial-farms-in-italy&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1562612996086000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHAxnZkqYIs8ilf3JhA2sKqRuTYUQ">120 billion farmed fish</a> are slaughtered for food every year.</p>
<p>Although plant-based alternatives for red meat – like the Impossible Burger and Beyond Burger &#8211; and poultry – like The Imposter Burger &#8211; have been on the rise, when it comes to fish – we’ve fallen behind. Fish is as much a part of our diets as meat from land animals, so it only makes sense for there to be plant-based seafood options available for those who want to cut back on conventional products.</p>

<p>There’s much work to be done around making fishing more humane and sustainable, but this must go alongside efforts to dampen demand. Plant- and cell-based meat companies continue to encourage and support those looking to reduce their red meat and poultry intake – and now there’s growing attention on doing the same for fish. We must make sure there are alternatives available to catch people who have woken up to the damage caused by our growing demand for fish.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It took 20 years to break the Goodwood Festival of Speed hill climb record. And it happened twice in the same weekend.</p>
<p>The new record holder is Volkswagen&#8217;s ID R electric race car. The vehicle, driven by driver Romain Dumas, broke the record by completing the 1.86-kilometer track (1.15 miles) at Goodwood in the south of England in 41.18 seconds. Dumas then broke his own record the following day by completing the track in 39.90 seconds.</p>
<p>The previous record at the famous hillclimb was set in 1999 by Nick Heidfeld who was driving a 780-horsepower McLaren-Mercedes MP4/13 with a combustion engine. Heidfeld completed the run in 41.6 seconds.</p>
<p>The Volkswagen ID R (and Dumas) has been on a tear as of late setting records at <a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/605336-minutes-volkswagen-idr-sets-new-electric-record-on-the-nuerburgring-5045">Nürburgring-Nordschleife</a> and Pikes Peak. The ID R set a new electric vehicle lap record at Nürburgring-Nordschleife by completing the course in 6:05.336 minutes. The previous record was set in 2017 by Peter Dumbreck, who was driving a Nio electric vehicle.</p>
<p>The Volkswagen ID R was modified to best suit the Goodwood hill climb. A vehicle was outfitted with a smaller battery, which helped reduce the weight, and the power output was optimized for the short sprint. A drag reduction system designed for high-speed sections of the Nürburgring.</p>
<p>Why does all of this matter? This race car is a testbed and a flagship for Volkswagen&#8217;s ID electric vehicle platform.</p>
<p>Volkswagen has been showing off its ID line of concept electric vehicles for several years. The company is preparing some of them for production, beginning with the ID.3. VW aims to sell 100,000 ID.3 vehicles annually.</p>
<p>The ID.3 hatchback is the first model to be built on the automaker’s new Modular Electric Drive Toolkit, or MEB, electric-car architecture. Introduced in 2016, MEB is a flexible modular system — really a matrix of common parts — for producing electric vehicles that VW says makes it more efficient and cost-effective.</p>
<p>Others will soon follow. VW plans to have a portfolio of more than 20 full-electric models. The automaker’s goal is to sell 1 million electric vehicles annually by 2025.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Landon Brand and Benjamin Stanfield graduated from the University of Southern California this year, they already had the plans for <a href="https://projectwren.com/">Project Wren</a>, their service for selling carbon offsets to a new generation of conscious consumers.</p>
<p>Along with fellow co-founder <span style="font-weight: 400;">Mimi Tran Zambetti (who&#8217;s still attending USC), Brand and Stanfield aim to make carbon offsets more accessible to people who may feel like there&#8217;s nothing they can do on a personal level to reduce their carbon footprint or support projects that reduce carbon emissions. </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a novel concept. In 2004, <a href="https://www.terrapass.com/">TerraPass</a> launched its service to provide carbon offsets for consumers. The company was acquired in 2014 and now operates as a subsidiary of the publicly traded Canadian retail energy company, Just Energy.</p>
<p>Since <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/terrapass" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="terrapass">TerraPass, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> other organizations have come in with services to offset consumer and corporate carbon emissions. The Swiss non-profit <a href="https://www.myclimate.org/">MyClimate</a> is another organization working on offsets for corporations and individuals (as is the German non-profit, <a href="https://www.atmosfair.de">Atmosfair</a>) and the North American public benefit corporation, <a href="https://nativeenergy.com/">NativeEnergy</a> also has both a retail and corporate offset program.</p>
<p>Project Wren sources its offset investments from <a href="https://www.drawdown.org/">Project Drawdown</a> and is trying to choose the projects that the company&#8217;s founders consider &#8220;most additional&#8221;, according to Brand.</p>
<p>Brand, Stanfield and Tran Zambetti met at USC while pursuing a bachelor of science degree in USC&#8217;s new <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/jimmy-iovine" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="jimmy-iovine">Jimmy Iovine <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Andre Young Academy. The two men are the co-founders of Beats, which sold to Apple for roughly $3 billion, but perhaps are more famous for their work in the music business as the co-founder of Interscope records and the rapper and producer known as Dr. Dre.</p>
<p>From the outset the three students worked together on side projects and in student organizations, and decided last year to launch a sustainable business that could impact consumers in a positive way. The first idea, and the one that was initially incorporated as Project Wren, was to develop an algorithmically enhanced software service to promote diversity and inclusion in companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea was promising, but it&#8217;s a hard product to sell. Companies aren&#8217;t used to leveraging software to help build their culture,&#8221; Brand wrote in an email. &#8220;Trying to get people to use the product made us realize how difficult it is to build something that&#8217;s useful and good for the world. If we were going to build a company around doing good, it would take a decade or more.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group convened earlier this year and decided, after spending a year working on their idea, that the over ten years it would take to build a successful business was too long for them to see the impact they wanted to make in the world. &#8220;We felt like the mission of making companies a better place to work was important, but not urgent,&#8221; Brand wrote to me in an email. &#8220;Climate change is urgent. It&#8217;s the biggest challenge humanity has ever faced. That&#8217;s why we decided to pivot.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group then decided that they would pool their resources on another project &#8212; a vegan cloud kitchen that could potentially become a franchise or chain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meat production is responsible for as much as 20% of greenhouse gas emissions,&#8221; Brand wrote. &#8220;If we could make eating vegan food easier than eating meat, we would have a huge impact.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group ran a cloud kitchen out of Brand&#8217;s apartment for two weeks before deciding that, too, ultimately was a wash for the three young co-founders.</p>
<p>With that idea behind them, the three began researching carbon offsets, which led them to Project Drawdown, which led them to build their current website and, ultimately, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/y-combinator" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="y-combinator">Y Combinator <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Customers who buy offsets using Wren will support projects that the company has selected for their additionality (meaning the projects would not have been done without the support of organizations like Wren). Once the offsets are purchased Project Wren retires them from circulation so they can&#8217;t be traded on any exchange after their creation.</p>
<p>The company makes money by taking a 20% commission above the price of the project for operating expenses and marketing, says Brand.</p>
<p>What Brand sees as the young company&#8217;s competitive advantage is its ability to communicate more directly with a new audience of offset acquirers &#8212; engaging them more in the process by providing updates on the project.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Photos, and stories too, from people on the ground will add a more human, real, touch,&#8221; to the projects and their reporting back to carbon offset buyers, according to Brand. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We just talk to a bunch of potential partners and see which partners would be able to give unique compelling updates to our users.&#8221;</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You wake up, and check your phone, and see a new condemnation. Some awful person has said something outrageously insulting. Something actually evil, if you think about it. Something that belittles, dehumanizes, and/or argues against the freedom and agency of a whole category of people.</p>
<p>You add your voice to the furious chorus in response. How can you not? These people may never understand how wrong they are, they&#8217;re too ignorant and wedded to their idiocy for that, but they need to know that they are opposed, and their opponents are legion.</p>
<p>We all know what you mean when you say &#8216;these people.&#8217; The ones who voted for those awful faces on every news site and TV channel, the ones whose names alone cause you to clench with fury. The ones responsible for the awful, unforgivable things happening at the border. The ones responsible for the reports of violence in the streets.</p>
<p>If pushed you&#8217;d probably admit that only some of These People are genuinely evil. More than you could have imagined in your worst nightmares five years ago, but still, only some. Others may be prisoners of their upbringing, or their ignorance, or victims of their own hardships, lashing out wildly. But what they all seem to have in common is an incapacity for compassion.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to distance yourself from Them. It&#8217;s hard not to. The overwhelming majority of the people with whom you actually interact are Us.</p>
<p>You know you should try to feel compassion for Them, as you should for everyone. Not sympathy. Sympathy is very different. But your religion, or your spirituality, or your morality, or simply your belief, teaches you compassion for all. But how can you hold compassion for people who seem incapable of compassion themselves? People who don&#8217;t condemn, who actually cheer, what&#8217;s happening at the border?</p>
<p>And so every online outrage leaches a little more compassion away, widens and deepens the abyss between Us and Them a little further. You know intellectually that many of these viral outrages stem from bots, <a href="https://twitter.com/Walldo/status/1146586972107841538">programmed</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/Walldo/status/1146589654675673088">trolls</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/viveka/status/1146924614171283456">worse</a>, and each new one does not represent every member of &#8230; them.</p>
<p>But you can&#8217;t help but grow more certain with each new outrage, in your heart if not your head, that there is a Them. That there are no longer people with whom one can reasonably disagree. That there are now only Us, and Them.</p>
<p>You realize when you think about it that this makes it easier to give people who are notionally Us a pass when they too behave with a flagrant lack of compassion, or judge people&#8217;s whole lives by their worst moments, or prioritize the purity of the process they have decreed over any actual results accomplished.</p>
<p>You realize that the growing abyss between Us and Them makes both sides close ranks, makes it harder for people who are Them and yet who have uneasy, even horrified feelings about what&#8217;s happening at the border in their name, to at least speak against it. They should anyway. Of course they should. But people are weak. The easier something becomes, the more that people do it.</p>
<p>You understand, on some level, that the online divide is different from the awful things actually happening offline. That the latter matters, deeply, and the former &#8230; not so much. That the former distracts both sides from great systemic injustices which have learned to lie hidden in bland terminology, coolly steering clear of the outrage of Us versus Them.</p>
<p>But you slept poorly, you&#8217;re exhausted, and you already have so much to do, so many duties to attend to at your frustrating job, so many worries to keep at bay, once you get out of this bed. Maybe all that is because of those systemic injustices, but those are a rot, those are cancer, those are bone-deep, and the evils at the border are an open wound about which something must done immediately. They are responsible for those evils. They must be fought and stopped.</p>
<p>So you add your voice to the furious chorus. And you give more money to those fighting the real fight at the border, because you know that&#8217;s what&#8217;s actually important. And maybe before you roll out of bed you pause to wonder how much the great online divide represents reality, or how much it prefigures reality; whether They really have all lost <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-republican-party-has-changed-dramatically-since-george-h-w-bush-ran-it/">their minds</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/26/opinion/sunday/republican-platform-far-right.html">their moral compasses</a>.</p>
<p>And you can&#8217;t help but wonder: even if they haven&#8217;t, what can now be done?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello, weekenders. This is Week-in-Review where I give a heavy amount of analysis and/or rambling thoughts on one story while scouring the rest of the hundreds of stories that emerged on TechCrunch this week to surface my favorites for your reading pleasure.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Last week, I talked about the cult of Ive and the degradation of Apple design. On Sunday night, The Wall Street Journal published a report on how Ive had been moving away from the company to the dismay of many on the design team. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/01/tim-cook-hits-send/">Tim Cook didn&#8217;t like the report very much</a>. Our EIC gave a little breakdown on the whole saga in a nice piece he did.</p>

<h2>The big story</h2>
<p>This week was a tad restrained in its eventfulness, seems like the newsmakers went on 4th of July vacations a little early. Amazon made a bit of news this week when the company confirmed that Alexa request logs are kept indefinitely.</p>
<p>Last week, an Amazon public policy exec answered some questions about Alexa in a letter sent to U.S. Senator Coons. His office published the letter on its site a few days ago and most of the details aren&#8217;t all that surprising but the first answer really sets the tone for how Amazon sees Alexa activity.</p>
<p><em><strong>Q: How long does Amazon store the transcripts of user voice recordings?</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>A: We retain customers’ voice recordings and transcripts until the customer chooses to delete them.</strong></em></p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting about this isn&#8217;t that we&#8217;re only now getting this level of straightforward dialogue from Amazon on how long data is kept if not specifically deleted, but it makes one wonder why it is useful or feasible for them to keep it indefinitely.  <em>(This assumes that they actually are keeping it indefinitely, it seems likely that most of it isn&#8217;t and that by saying this they&#8217;re protecting themselves legally, but I&#8217;m just going off the letter.)</em></p>
<p>After several years of &#8220;Hey Alexa,&#8221; the company doesn&#8217;t seem all that close to figuring out what it is.</p>
<p>Alexa seems to be a shit solution for commerce, so why does Amazon have 10,000 people working on it, according to a report this week in <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/alexa-is-voice-still-the-next-big-thing-after-mobile">The Information</a>? All signs are pointing to the voice assistant experiment being a short term failure in terms of the short term ambitions though AI advances will push the utility.</p>
<p>Training data is a big deal across AI teams looking to educate models on datasets of relevant information. The company seems to say as much. &#8220;Our speech recognition and natural language understanding systems use machine learning to adapt to customers’ speech patterns and vocabulary, informed by the way customers use Alexa in the real world. To work well, machine learning systems need to be trained using real world data.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company says it doesn&#8217;t anonymize any of this data because it has to stay associated with a user&#8217;s account in order for them to delete it. I&#8217;d feel a lot better if Amazon just effectively anonymized the data in the first place and used on-device processing the build a profile on my voice for personalized . What I&#8217;m more afraid of is Amazon having such a detailed voiceprint of everyone who has ever used an Alexa device.</p>
<p>If effortless voice-based e-commerce isn&#8217;t really the product anymore, what is? The answer is always us, but I don&#8217;t like the idea of indefinitely leaving Amazon with my data until they figure out the answer.</p>

<h2>Trends of the week</h2>
<p>Here are a few big news items from big companies, with green links to all the sweet, sweet added context.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>NASA&#8217;s GPS moonshot</b><br />
The U.S. government really did us a solid inventing GPS, but NASA has some bigger ideas on the table for the positioning platform, namely, taking it to the moon.It might be a little complicated but unsurprisingly scientists have some ideas here. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/03/gps-on-the-moon-nasas-working-on-it/">Read more</a></li>
<li><strong>Apple has your eyes<br />
</strong>Most of the iOS beta updates are bug fixes, but the latest change to iOS13 brought a very strange surprise, changing the way the eyes of users on iPhone XS or XS Max look to people on the other end of the call. Instead of appearing that you&#8217;re looking below the camera, some software wizardry will now make it look like you&#8217;re staring directly at the camera. Apple hasn&#8217;t detailed how this works but here&#8217;s what we do know <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/03/apples-ios-13-update-will-make-facetime-eye-contact-way-easier/">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Trump is having a Twitter party<br />
</strong>Donald Trump&#8217;s administration declared a couple months ago that it was launching an exploratory survey to try and gain a sense of conservative voices that had been silenced on social media, now @realdonaldtrump is having a get together and inviting his friends to chat about the issue. It&#8217;s a real who&#8217;s who, check out some of the people attending <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/02/trump-taps-conservative-pundits-for-social-media-summit/">here</a>.</li>

<h2>Extra Crunch</h2>
</div>
<p>Our premium subscription service had another week of interesting deep dives. TechCrunch reporter Kate Clark did a great interview with the ex-Facebook, ex-Venmo founding team behind Fin and how they&#8217;re thinking about the consumerization of the enterprise.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/02/sam-lessin-and-andrew-kortina-on-their-voice-assistants-workplace-pivot/">Sam Lessin and Andrew Kortina on their voice assistant&#8217;s workplace pivot</a></h2>
<p>“…The thing is, developing an AI assistant capable of booking flights, arranging trips, teaching users how to play poker, identifying places to purchase specific items for a birthday party and answering wide-ranging zany questions like “can you look up a place where I can milk a goat?” requires a whole lot more human power than one might think. Capital-intensive and hard-to-scale, an app for “instantly offloading” chores wasn’t the best business. Neither Lessin nor Kortina will admit to failure, but <a href="https://www.fin.com/">Fin</a>‘s excursion into B2B enterprise software eight months ago suggests the assistant technology wasn’t a billion-dollar idea.…”</p></blockquote>
<p>Here are some of our other top reads this week for premium subscribers. This week, we talked a bit about asking for money and the future of China&#8217;s favorite tech platform.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to the transcribed edition of the popular podcast Equity. Kate Clark had the hosting reins this week and welcomed Revolution&#8217;s Clara Sieg to the studio.</p>
<p>They discussed the trend of investors backing companies from &#8220;second-tier&#8221; markets like Austin, Atlanta, Denver, Philadelphia, Seattle, etc. Just how do cities become tech hubs? It&#8217;s a special kind of recipe, Sieg says. A city must have a great university, or a few, nearby to provide a constant flow of talent. They need some big corporations around for the same reason. They need a healthy community of angel investors ready and willing to get things going.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Sieg: </strong>Fundamentally in these second and third tier markets, an idea on the back of a napkin doesn&#8217;t get funded, so you really have to bootstrap to a certain degree and prove out really economics before you can unlock capital. Typically the companies that we&#8217;re investing in at the Series A, Series B level are a little bit farther along than their brethren would be in the Bay Area or New York.</p>
<p>Valuation expectations are just lower so you own more of a company for a smaller check-in. Inherently, if it&#8217;s an exit, that is a better outcome for you and it&#8217;s just cheaper to scale companies in those markets. Employee retention is better, cost of living is lower, so the capital required to scale these companies and that&#8217;s coming in after you and diluting you is less.</p>
<p><strong>Clark: </strong>So when Steve Case founded Revolution, was he coming at it from the perspective of like, &#8220;This is obviously good business?&#8221; Which it is, to invest in these companies, or was it coming from a perspective of like, &#8220;It&#8217;s not fair that companies in these areas just don&#8217;t have access to capital like we do here in the Bay Area?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Sieg: </strong>Neither, really. I think our investing approach in the early days, and what we still focus on today is what is now commonly referred to as disruption, right? Historically, Zipcar was basically disrupting the rental car market, and it was not really thought of as a great venture-backable opportunity in the early days. That&#8217;s obviously changed now, transportation is a huge piece of what venture capitalists focus on, but from day one, we focused on sleepy, incumbent markets where technology can be an enabler of a new business model that makes it better, faster, cheaper for the consumer, or the business that it&#8217;s serving, and where you can change the margins in the business to create a market leader that incumbents then either have to own or that can be a large standalone company.</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; is one of Netflix&#8217;s biggest hits, we&#8217;ve remained immune to some of its charms.</p>
<p>On the latest episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/original-content/id1271763098">the Original Content podcast</a>, we review the third season of the series — a.k.a. &#8220;Stranger Things 3&#8221; — giving us an opportunity to hash out our general feelings about the show.</p>
<p>Darrell, in particular, embraced the first season&#8217;s mix of &#8217;80s horror and nostalgia, only to feel that season two was little more than a repeat. (There was an episode that branched out, but we&#8217;ve all kind of forgotten about the hour devoted to gang of telekinetic teens.) In many ways, &#8220;Stranger Things 3&#8221; continues that trend, with the residents of Hawkins  forced once again to confront a malevolent being from another dimension.</p>
<p>To be fair, the villain known as the Mind Flayer isn&#8217;t just doing the same stuff this time. He has a whole new evil plan. But &#8220;Strange Things 3&#8221; feels freshest when it&#8217;s less focused on the sci-fi plot, and more when it&#8217;s dealing with the rapidly maturing cast, as many of the younger characters find themselves becoming angsty teenagers.</p>
<p>And yes, we enjoyed all those scenes in the town&#8217;s new mall. It seems like an obvious ploy for nostalgia, but the nostalgia works.</p>
<p>In addition to our review, we also discussed Netflix&#8217;s plans for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/02/netflix-sandman/">a big-budget &#8220;Sandman&#8221; show</a>, and Jordan shared some of her latest TV recommendations.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello and welcome back to Startups Weekly, a weekend newsletter that dives into the week’s noteworthy startups &amp; venture capital news. Before I jump into today’s topic, let’s catch up a bit. Last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/29/startups-weekly-whats-next-for-wework/">I struggled to understand WeWork&#8217;s growth trajectory</a>. Before that, I noted some thoughts on<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/22/startups-weekly-the-scooter-cash-desert/"> scooter companies&#8217; struggle to raise new cash</a>.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s on my mind this week? Data. Now that it&#8217;s July, I figured it was time for a VC investment data check-in. How much have VCs invested so far this year? Are they finally investing more in female founders? I&#8217;ve got answers. (Data source: PitchBook)</p>
<ul>
<li>So far in 2019, VCs have invested $62 billion in U.S. startups. This puts investors on pace to dole out more than $120 billion this year, surpassing last year&#8217;s all-time high of $117 billion.</li>
<li>Around the world, VCs have invested a total of $104 billion in 2019. Last year, investment soared to $251 billion. We&#8217;re unlikely to observe a global record of VC investment this year.</li>
<li>Here&#8217;s the best news of all: Companies founded solely by women have secured a record 3% of the total capital invested in VC-backed startups in the U.S. this year: &#8220;Capital invested crossed the $1 billion mark for female-founded startups in 1Q 2019—the highest ever for any quarter to date. And out of roughly 300 VC deals for companies led solely by women, four of those businesses have reached unicorn status so far this year. That number includes online luxury reseller <a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/54134-83" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The RealReal</a>, which debuted on the NASDAQ in a high-profile exit last month,&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/5-women-led-firms-crushing-the-gender-gap-in-vc">PitchBook</a>.<br />

<p>A compelling pitch deck that quickly and clearly presents your startup as an exceptional investment opportunity is a clear edge when raising a round. But could fundraising be more effective if you knew <i>when</i> to send your pitch deck – the times of year when it’s more likely to be reviewed and when it’s likely to be viewed more often? If we all had a magical algorithm that could predict exactly which investors would review your deck and when, we’d be fundraising geniuses — closing our round faster and with far less effort. No such algorithm exists (at least not yet), but I can share some useful data that offers insights into some of these seasonal fundraising trends, with a few that seem to defy conventional wisdom&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Away from the limelight of the press and the frenzy of fundraising, a tech startup in India has achieved a feat that few of its peers have managed: going public.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.indiamart.com">IndiaMART</a>, the country’s largest online platform for selling products directly to businesses, raised nearly $70 million in a rare tech IPO for India this week.</p>
<p>The milestone for the 23-year-old firm is so uncommon for India’s otherwise burgeoning startup ecosystem that, beyond being over-subscribed 36 times, pent up demand for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/indiamart" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="indiamart">IndiaMART’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> stock saw its share price pop 40% on its first day of trading on National Stock Exchange on Thursday &#8212; a momentum that it sustained on Friday.</p>
<p>The stock ended Friday at Rs 1326 ($19.3), compared to its issue price of Rs 973 ($14.2).</p>
<p>IndiaMART is the first business-to-business e-commerce firm to go public in India. Its IPO also marks the first listing for a firm following the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/india-modi-silicon-valley-future-internet/">May reelection of Narendra Modi</a> as the nation’s Prime Minister and the months-long drought that led to it.</p>
<p>Accounting firm EY said it expects more companies from India to follow suit and file for IPO in the coming months.</p>
<p>“Now that national elections are over and favorable results secured, IPO activity is expected to gain momentum in H2 2019 (second half of the year). Companies that had filed their offer documents with the Indian stock markets regulator during H2 2018 and Q1 2019 may finally come to market in the months ahead,” it <a href="https://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/ey-global-ipo-trends-q2-2019/$FILE/ey-global-ipo-trends-q2-2019.pdf">said in a statement</a> (PDF).</p>
<h2>IndiaMART&#8217;s origin</h2>
<p>The fireworks of the IPO are just as impressive as IndiaMART&#8217;s journey.</p>
<p>The startup was founded in 1996 and for the first 13 years, it focused on exports to customers abroad, but it has since modernized its business following the wave of the internet.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thesis was, in 1996, there were no computers or internet in India. The information about India&#8217;s market to the West was very limited,&#8221; Dinesh Agarwal, co-founder and CEO of IndiaMART, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>Until 2008, IndiaMART was fully bootstrapped and profitable with $10 million in revenue, Agarwal said. But things started to dramatically change in that year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Indian rupee became very strong against the dollar, which dwindled the exports business. This is also when the stock market was collapsing in the West, which further hurt the exports demand,&#8221; he explained.</p>

<p>By this time, millions of people in India were on the internet and, with tens of millions of people owning a feature phone, the conditions of the market had begun to shift towards digital.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is when we decided to pursue a completely different path. We started to focus on the domestic market,&#8221; Agarwal said.</p>
<p>Over the last 10 years, IndiaMART has become the largest e-commerce platform for businesses with about 60% market share, according to research firm KPMG. It handles 97,000 product categories &#8212; ranging from machine parts, medical equipment and textile products to cranes &#8212; and has amassed 83 million buyers and 5.5 million suppliers from thousands of towns and cities of India.</p>
<p>According to the most recent data published by the Indian government, there are about 50 to 60 million small and medium-sized businesses in India, but only around 10 million of them have any presence on the web. Some 97% of the top 50 companies listed on National Stock Exchange use IndiaMART&#8217;s services, Agarwal said.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that the transition to the current day was a straightforward process for the company. IndiaMART tried to capitalize on its early mover advantage with a stream of new services which ultimately didn&#8217;t reap the desired rewards.</p>
<p>In 2002, it <a href="https://corporate.indiamart.com/2002/01/21/travel-portal/">launched</a> a travel portal for businesses. A year later, it launched a business verification service. It also <a href="https://corporate.indiamart.com/2005/02/04/abcpayments/">unveiled</a> a payments platform called ABCPayments. None of these services worked and the firm quickly moved on.</p>
<p>Part of IndiaMART’s success story is its firm leadership and how cautiously it has raised and spent its money, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/rajesh-sawhney" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="rajesh-sawhney">Rajesh Sawhney, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a serial angel investor who sits on IndiaMART’s board, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>IndiaMART, which employs about 4,000 people, is operationally profitable as of the financial year that ended in March this year. It clocked some $82 million in revenue in the year. It has raised about $32 million to date from Intel Capital, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amadeus-capital-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amadeus-capital-partners">Amadeus Capital Partners <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Quona Capital. (Notably, Agarwal said that he <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/interviews/uploading-sites-on-a-dial-up-connection-was-an-all-night-job-dinesh-agarwal-indiamart/articleshow/61515579.cms">rejected offers</a> from VCs for a very long time.)</p>
<p>The firm makes most of its revenue from subscriptions it sells to sellers. A subscription gives a seller a range of benefits including getting featured on storefronts.</p>

<h2>Where the industry stands</h2>
<p>There are only a handful of internet companies in India that have gone public in the last decade. Online travel service MakeMyTrip went public in 2010. Software firm Intellect Design Arena and e-commerce store Koovs listed in 2014, then travel portal Yatra and e-commerce firm Infibeam followed two years later.</p>
<p>India has consistently attracted billions of dollars in funding in recent years and produced many unicorns. Those include <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/flipkart" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="flipkart">Flipkart, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/20/walmart-flipkart-deal-done/">acquired by Walmart last year for $16 billion</a>, Paytm, which has raised more than $2 billion to date, Swiggy, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/swiggy-raises-1-billion/">bagged $1.5 billion to date</a>, Zomato, which has raised $750 million, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/17/byjus-raises-540-million/">relatively new entrant Byju’s</a> &#8212; but few of them are nearing profitability and most likely do not see an IPO in their immediate future.</p>
<p>In that context, IndiaMART may set a benchmark for others to follow.</p>
<p>“The fact that we have a homegrown digital commerce business, serving both the urban and smaller cities, and having struggled and been around for so long building a very difficult business and finally going public in the local exchange is a phenomenal story,” Ganesh Rengaswamy, a partner at Quona Capital, told TechCrunch in an interview. “It keeps the story of India tech, to the Western world, going.”</p>

<p>Generally, it is agreed that there are too few IPOs in India and the industry can benefit from momentum and encouragement of high profile and successful public listings.</p>
<p>“There is a firm consensus that in India, markets will prefer only the IPOs of companies that are profitable. And investors in India might not value those companies. Both of these issues are being addressed by IndiaMART,” said Sawhney.</p>
<p>“We need 30 to 40 more IPOs. This will also mean that the stock market here has matured and understands the tech stocks and how it is different from other consumer stocks they usually handle. More tech companies going public would also pave the way for many to explore stock exchanges outside of India.</p>
<p>“Indian market is ready for more tech stocks. We just need to get more companies to go out there,” Sawhney added, although he did predict that it will take a few years before the vast majority of leading startups are ready for the public market.</p>

<p>The Indian government, for its part, this week announced a number of incentives to uplift the &#8220;entrepreneurial spirit&#8221; in the nation.</p>
<p>Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government would ease foreign direct investment rules for certain sectors &#8212; including e-commerce, food delivery, grocery &#8212; and improve the digital payments ecosystem. Sitharaman, who is the first woman to hold this position in India, said the government would also launch a TV program to help startups connect with venture capitalists.</p>
<h2>The path ahead for IndiaMART</h2>
<p>IndiaMART has managed to build a sticky business that compels more than 55% of its customers to come back to the platform and make another transaction within 90 days, Agarwal &#8212; its CEO &#8212; said. With some 3,500 of its 4,000 employees classified as sales executives, the company is aggressive in its pursuit of new customers. Moving forward, that will remain one of its biggest focuses, according to Agarwal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of our time still goes into educating MSMEs on how to use the internet. That was a challenge 20 years ago and it remains a challenge today,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>In recent years, IndiaMART has begun to expand its suite of offerings to its business customers in a bid to increase the value they get from its platform and thus increase their reliance on its service.</p>
<p>IndiaMART has built a customer relationship management (CRM) tool so that customers need not rely on spreadsheets or other third-party services.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue to explore more SaaS offerings and look into solving problems in accounting, invoice management and other areas,&#8221; said Agarwal.</p>
<p>The firm also recently started to offer payment facilitation between buyers and sellers through a <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/paypal" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="paypal">PayPal <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-like escrow system.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will bridge the trust gap between the entities and improve an MSME&#8217;s ability to accept all kinds of payment options including the new age offerings.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an elephant in the room, however.</p>
<p>A bigger challenge that looms for IndiaMART is the growing interest of Amazon and Walmart in the business-to-business space. Several startups including Udaan &#8212; which has raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/03/udaan-the-e-commerce-startup-led-by-three-former-flipkart-executives-has-raised-225m/">north of $280 million</a> from DST Global and Lightspeed Venture Partners &#8212; have risen up in recent years and are increasingly expanding their operations. Agarwal did not seem much worried, however, telling TechCrunch that he believes that his prime competition is more focused on B2C and serving niche audiences. Besides he has $100 million in the bank himself.</p>
<p>Indeed, as Quona Capital&#8217;s Rengaswamy astutely noted, competition is not new for IndiaMART &#8212; the company has survived and thrived more than two decades of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alibaba came and gave up,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>An important &#8212; and unanswered question &#8212; that follows the successful IPO is how IndiaMART&#8217;s stock will fare over the coming months. A glance to the U.S. &#8212; where hyped companies like Uber, Lyft and others have seen prices taper off &#8212; shows clearly that early demand and sustained stock performance are not one and the same.</p>
<p>Nobody knows at this point, and the added complexity at play is that the concept of a tech IPO is so uncommon in India that there is no definitive answer to it&#8230; yet. But IndiaMART&#8217;s biggest achievement may be that it sets the pathway that many others will follow.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cloud gaming — however a company chooses to define that — is shaping up to be a big part of the next generation of consoles and other platforms. But Mario creator and Nintendo veteran Shigeru Miyamoto says his company won&#8217;t be so quick to jump on the bandwagon.</p>
<p>Speaking to shareholders at Nintendo&#8217;s annual general meeting, Miyamoto and other executives addressed a variety of issues, among them what some interpret as a failure to keep up with the state of the industry. Sony and Microsoft <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/16/rivals-in-gaming-microsoft-and-sony-team-up-on-cloud-services/">(together, amazingly)</a> are about to lock horns with Google, Nvidia, and others in the arena of game streaming, but Nintendo has announced no plans whatsoever regarding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/game-streamings-multi-industry-melee-is-about-to-begin/">the powerful new technology</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="fwOrVfVROv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/game-streamings-multi-industry-melee-is-about-to-begin/">Game streaming&#8217;s multi-industry melee is about to begin</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe title="&#8220;Game streaming&#8217;s multi-industry melee is about to begin&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/game-streamings-multi-industry-melee-is-about-to-begin/embed/#?secret=fwOrVfVROv" data-secret="fwOrVfVROv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-07-05-shigeru-miyamoto-games-will-still-be-fun-without-streaming">As reported by GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Miyamoto was unfazed by this allegation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe it is important to continue to use these diverse technical environments to make unique entertainment that could only have been made by Nintendo,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have not fallen behind with either VR or network services&#8230; Because we don&#8217;t publicize this until we release a product, it may look like we&#8217;re falling behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>But although this hinted that Nintendo is working in this direction, Miyamoto didn&#8217;t sound convinced that cloud gaming was a home run.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that cloud gaming will become more widespread in the future, but I have no doubt that there will continue to be games that are fun <em>because</em> they are running locally and not on the cloud,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Nintendo focus on local multiplayer and complete offline single-player games is certainly emblematic of this point of view. And while Nintendo has been slow to adopt the latest gaming trends, it has shown that it can pull them off very well, indeed like no other, for example with the excellent Splatoon 2 and its constantly evolving seasons and events.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="euZdcKmuoM"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/14/nintendo-exec-on-e3-streaming-and-game-delays/">Nintendo exec on E3, streaming and game delays</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe title="&#8220;Nintendo exec on E3, streaming and game delays&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/14/nintendo-exec-on-e3-streaming-and-game-delays/embed/#?secret=euZdcKmuoM" data-secret="euZdcKmuoM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa said they see how gaming technology is evolving and that it&#8217;s important to &#8220;keep up with such changes,&#8221; but like Miyamoto made no indication that there was anything concrete on the way.</p>
<p>Instead, he indicated (again in true Nintendo style) that the company would reap the benefits of cloud gaming whether or not it took part in the practice.</p>
<p>&#8220;if these changes increase the worldwide gaming population, that will just give us more opportunities with our integrated hardware and software development approach to reach people worldwide with the unique entertainment that Nintendo can provide,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In other words, a rising tide lifts all boats, and if the others did the work to raise the water level, well, that&#8217;s their business.</p>
<p>The rumor on everyone&#8217;s mind after E3 is whether a new Switch or Switches are on the way. Naturally Furukawa demurred, saying that of course they were aware of speculation, but wouldn&#8217;t comment. However, he added: &#8220;It would spoil the surprise for consumers and is against the interests of our shareholders, so we are withholding any discussion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course a new Switch is on the way — that&#8217;s about as much as a confirmation anyone would be able to get from Furukawa or the other highly trained executives at Nintendo, even if the new hardware was coming out tomorrow. But at this rate it seems more likely that the new hardware will be timed to pull in buyers around the holidays — which may have the knock-on effect of taking the wind out of Microsoft and Sony&#8217;s sails (and sales) when they debut <em>their</em> next-generation consoles next year.</p>

A design firm in Italy has put together a lovely little show that collected sketches from the art community and put them all together in a giant mural, painted over 12 hours by a team of drones.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen spray-painting drones before, of course, but this is far better than the crude <a href="https://abc7.com/entertainment/drone-spray-paints-kendall-jenner-billboard-in-new-york-city/690399/">vandalism of a fashion billboard</a> or even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/04/this-autonomous-spray-painting-drone-is-a-21st-century-taggers-dream/">Disney&#8217;s more structured wall drawings</a>. These drones actually put together something worth looking at!</p>
<p><img class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1852590" title="spraydrone" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/spraydrone.jpg" alt="spraydrone" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/spraydrone.jpg 1833w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/spraydrone.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/spraydrone.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/spraydrone.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/spraydrone.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/spraydrone.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The Urban Flying Opera project was curated by Carlo Ratti Associati, which collected some 1,200 small illustrations via an app, selecting 100 to assemble into a single mural. The line drawings were then loaded into a central control computer and painting instructions relayed to a set of four drones equipped with paint cans, which worked over a 12-hour period to put the whole thing together.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1852589" title="drones_painting" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/drones_painting.gif" alt="drones painting" width="600" height="304" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1852588" title="ufo_drones" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ufo_drones.gif" alt="ufo drones" width="600" height="383" /></p>
<p>Each drone, provided by Tsuru Robotics (it&#8217;s partly a promotion for the company) was operating as part of a whole, with multiple position monitoring systems making sure they didn&#8217;t accidentally bump into one another. No second chances when you&#8217;re spray painting a white wall.</p>
<p>The mural is 46 feet wide and 39 feet tall, and each color layer, laid on separately, represents a different aspect of the community the project is trying to highlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;The city is an open canvas, where people can inscribe their stories in many ways. Such processes have always been happening; however, with UFO we tried to accelerate them, using drone technology to allow for a new use of painting as a means of expression,&#8221; <a href="https://newatlas.com/ufo-drones-graffiti-painting/60423/">CRA founder Carlo Ratti told New Atlas</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still nowhere near the level of fidelity you see in serious graffiti and street art, but it&#8217;s clear that drone-based spray painting is becoming a viable method rather than a lark. Perhaps even future drone-based vandalism will be of higher quality!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://nextventures.com/team">Next Ventures</a>, an investment firm led by Lance Armstrong, has <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1781390/000156761919014452/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">filed</a> to raise $75 million for its debut venture capital fund.</p>
<p>According to paperwork submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission this morning, Armstrong and Next Ventures general partner Lionel Conacher have so far attracted $24.5 million from limited partners to back startups in the sports, fitness, nutrition and wellness markets.</p>
<p>Both Armstrong and Conacher are long-time athletes, with Armstrong, of course, known for his professional cycling career and high-profile doping scandal that resulted in the International Cycling Union stripping him of his seven Tour de France titles in 2012. Conacher&#8217;s bio states he is &#8220;a life-long multi-sport athlete and outdoorsman and proud member of Canada’s first family of sport.&#8221; Conacher also has experience in investment banking and private equity as the former vice chairman of Roth Capital Partners.</p>
<p>Next Ventures <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/16/lance-armstrong-just-wrote-his-first-check-as-vc/">disclosed its first investment six months ago</a>. The fund supplied capital to Carlsbad, Calif.-based <a href="https://www.powerdot.com/">PowerDot</a>, a 2.5-year-old maker of an app-based, smart muscle stimulation device that sends electrical pulses to contract tender soft tissue, helping runners and other athletes recover from their workouts. The firm has since invested in sleep and activity tracker <a href="https://ouraring.com/">Oura</a>, community-building fitness app <a href="https://getspar.com/">Spar</a>, and <a href="https://nextventures.com/investments">two others</a>.</p>
<p>Armstrong, banned from cycling for life, got his start in investing after serving as an LP to Lowercase Capital. Through his investment in Lowercase, he received early stock in Uber that he claims “saved” his family from financial ruin.</p>
<p>If Armstrong and Conacher reach their targeted amount, Next Ventures would become one of the larger sports and fitness-focused funds as VCs double down on an industry led by Peloton&#8217;s sky-high success.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Moon landing, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/national-geographic" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="national-geographic">National Geographic <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has plans for an entire Space Week of programming, kicking off Sunday night with the premiere of a new documentary called &#8220;Apollo: Missions to the Moon.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a story that&#8217;s been told many times, including in last year&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/12/first-man-movie/">Neil Armstrong biopic &#8220;First Man.&#8221;</a> And of course, there&#8217;s <a href="https://www.tvinsider.com/790185/apollo-11-moon-landing-50th-anniversary-tv-specials/">a whole slate of new documentaries and specials</a> airing in the next few weeks — something that &#8220;Apollo: Missions to the Moon&#8221; director Tom Jennings acknowledged with a rueful laugh when we spoke on the phone.</p>
<p>But Jennings brought his distinctive approach to the project, one that he&#8217;s employed in previous documentaries like &#8220;Challenger Disaster: Lost Tapes&#8221; and &#8220;Diana: In Her Own Words.&#8221; The idea is to rely entirely on archival audio, video and photos, so that viewers can experience the story in the present tense, rather than hearing about it from talking heads 50 years later.</p>
<p>In this case, National Geographic says the film draws on 800 hours of audio, 500 hours of film and more than 10,000 photos. That includes previously unheard audio from Mission Control.</p>
<p>&#8220;In documentaries in the past, whether it’s the Moon landing or any of the Apollo missions, when you would hear audio in Mission Control, it&#8217;s a single line open line — that was the guy called CAPCOM,&#8221; Jennings said. &#8220;[But] there were hundreds of people there, and many of them are wearing headsets.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1852599" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1852599" class="size-large wp-image-1852599" title="Apollo Missions to the Moon" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pre_3883f77151158f24ae14e0322d9c1b07.jpg?w=680" alt="Apollo Missions to the Moon" width="680" height="460" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pre_3883f77151158f24ae14e0322d9c1b07.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pre_3883f77151158f24ae14e0322d9c1b07.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pre_3883f77151158f24ae14e0322d9c1b07.jpg?resize=300,203 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pre_3883f77151158f24ae14e0322d9c1b07.jpg?resize=768,519 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pre_3883f77151158f24ae14e0322d9c1b07.jpg?resize=680,460 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pre_3883f77151158f24ae14e0322d9c1b07.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1852599" class="wp-caption-text">Flurry of handshakes erupts after successful launch of Apollo 11 (NASA)</p></div></p>
<p>So by incorporating this new audio, the film can give a fuller picture of what was happening in Mission Control, and how the Earth-bound team was responding to events in space.</p>
<p>Also worth emphasizing: The film tells the story of the whole Apollo program, not just Apollo 11. It spends more time on some missions than others, but the idea is to give viewers the full context of how we got to the Moon, and what happened after.</p>
<p>That includes tracing the program&#8217;s Cold War roots, although Jennings said that over time, it became &#8220;less and less about the space race and the Russians&#8221; and more about &#8220;doing the impossible.&#8221; Or, as he summed it up, &#8220;It became more about the expedition and less about the politics.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the big elements in the story is the breathless way the media followed the initial missions. (&#8220;The media was a character.&#8221;) After all, Apollo 7 featured the first live television broadcast from a crewed space mission, and one of the most striking scenes shows how people around the world were watching Apollo 1.</p>
<p>&#8220;How much the world stopped was unprecedented,&#8221; Jennings said. &#8220;I don’t think that it’ll ever happen again.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1852602" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1852602" class="size-large wp-image-1852602" title="Apollo Missions to the Moon" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pre_4a4ede317d9c056cf5ee3617b17aea47.jpg?w=680" alt="Apollo Missions to the Moon" width="680" height="468" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pre_4a4ede317d9c056cf5ee3617b17aea47.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pre_4a4ede317d9c056cf5ee3617b17aea47.jpg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pre_4a4ede317d9c056cf5ee3617b17aea47.jpg?resize=300,207 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pre_4a4ede317d9c056cf5ee3617b17aea47.jpg?resize=768,529 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pre_4a4ede317d9c056cf5ee3617b17aea47.jpg?resize=680,468 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pre_4a4ede317d9c056cf5ee3617b17aea47.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1852602" class="wp-caption-text">Aerial view of spectators around their campsites awaiting the Apollo 11 launch (Otis Imboden/National Geographic Creative)</p></div></p>
<p>Indeed, you can see that in the film itself, as public interest in the program begins to wane after the Moon landing. Jennings speculated, &#8220;It was about the quest. Once that quest was completed, it was like: Now what?&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, he said some of the footage cut from the film made that point as well, with &#8220;NASA spokespeople wandering around the press room after 11, before 13 got into trouble, basically saying, &#8216;For Apollo 11 this place was standing-room only, and now it&#8217;s just vacant.'&#8221;</p>
<p>And while the film doesn&#8217;t skimp on the triumph of Apollo 11, by tracing the full arc of the program, it ends on a melancholy note, as Apollo ends and NASA officials predict correctly that we won&#8217;t return to the Moon in their lifetimes. &#8220;Apollo: Missions to the Moon&#8221; doesn&#8217;t directly address what&#8217;s happened in more recent decades but you can&#8217;t help but see an implicit critique of NASA&#8217;s scaled-back ambitions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt like we needed the film to properly acknowledge what we’ve lost,&#8221; Jennings said. He recalled talking to Frances &#8220;Poppy&#8221; Northcutt, who worked as an engineer for the Apollo program, and she told him, &#8220;You know, everything was there. We were ready to go farther into deep space. If we had kept going we would have had people on Mars 30 years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, recent developments, like the work Jeff Bezos&#8217;s Blue Origin and Elon Musk&#8217;s SpaceX, have made him hopeful for the future: &#8220;I think we will go back to the Moon. Something will be set up on the Moon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Apollo: Missions to the Moon&#8221; will air on National Geographic on Sunday, July 7 at 9pm (8pm Central time).</p>

<p>In Alaska, all-time-high record temperatures were set across the state on July 4th, <a href="https://twitter.com/NWSAnchorage/status/1147126285866418176">according to the National Weather Service</a>. In Anchorage, the mercury soared to highs of 90 degrees, the highest temperature since recording began in 1952.</p>
<p>Temperatures in Alaska have reached 90 degrees in other cities around the state before, but this is the first time the thermometer hit that mark in Anchorage.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, hot winds blowing North from the Sahara set temperatures in Europe soaring to record highs, according to data <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/record-breaking-temperatures-june">released by the Copernicus Climate Change Service</a>.</p>
<p>It was Europe&#8217;s record three-degree temperature spike that brought global temperatures to their recorded-history highs.</p>

<p>“Although local temperatures may have been lower or higher than those forecast, our data show that the temperatures over the southwestern region of Europe during the last week of June were unusually high,&#8221; said Jean-Noël Thépaut, head of the Copernicus Climate Change Service. &#8220;Although this was exceptional, we are likely to see more of these events in the future due to climate change.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to data from Copernicus, the temperature spike across Europe was the highest on record for the month.</p>
<p>Compared for the same five-day period during the last 30-year climatological reference period, six to 10 degree Celsius temperature spikes happened in most of France and Germany, throughout northern Spain, northern Italy, Switzerland, Austria and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>As these events become common, the need for technologies that can reduce carbon emissions because more pressing.</p>
<p>Increasingly, businesses and investors are returning to the once-shunned market of clean technology and renewable energy to back new electric vehicle manufacturers, new energy efficient construction technologies, the rehabilitation of outdated infrastructure and consumer goods that have a smaller carbon footprint or reduce waste.</p>
<p>Data from <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/clean-energy-investment-exceeded-300-billion-2018/">Bloomberg New Energy Finance published earlier this year</a> indicated that venture investments into what was once called clean technology hit $9.2 billion in 2018. That&#8217;s the highest cumulative investment in the sector since 2009. Much of those deals were in Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers that attracted some $3.3 billion in venture capital and private equity dollars.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s critical, because global carbon emissions have increased over the past two years, according to <a href="http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/">estimates from the Global Carbon Project</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought, perhaps hoped, emissions had peaked a few years ago,” said <a href="https://mandrillapp.com/track/click/30855492/profiles.stanford.edu?p=eyJzIjoiOHBnc0l6X1JBR3MyVEhCQ18zWTN0R3NZcTZZIiwidiI6MSwicCI6IntcInVcIjozMDg1NTQ5MixcInZcIjoxLFwidXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3Byb2ZpbGVzLnN0YW5mb3JkLmVkdVxcXC9qYWNrc29uXCIsXCJpZFwiOlwiYzJkMjlmMDY5YTc1NDU1ODkxNTYwNzQ4YzQyYmI5YjhcIixcInVybF9pZHNcIjpbXCIyYTUyNjUzZTM5ZDA5NWM0ZWY5YmIyNzQ4ZmU1MmI4YTZiNGEzYzFjXCJdfSJ9">Rob Jackson</a>, a professor of Earth system science in Stanford’s <a href="http://earth.stanford.edu/">School of Earth, Energy &amp; Environmental Sciences </a>(Stanford Earth). “After two years of renewed growth, that was wishful thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the U.S. specifically, climate-related pressures (a warmer summer and a colder winter) led to increasing demand along with an uptick in gasoline consumption as demand for bigger vehicles fueled higher gas consumption.</p>
<p>“We’re driving more miles in bigger cars, changes that are outpacing improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency,” Jackson explained.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Personal air vehicles — those nifty electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft — have become one of the hottest aviation concepts since the Wright Flyer inspired a flood of competitors.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Touted as quieter, cleaner and cheaper than commercial helicopters, these electric air taxis promise to address city-dwellers’ mobility woes and have captured the attention of major aircraft and aerospace designers worldwide, including Bell Helicopter, Boeing and Airbus.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">With hundreds of millions in startup capital flowing to a nascent urban air mobility (UAM) industry, we might pause to ask: Can these new eVTOL aircraft serve rural areas, too? Could they help lift economic prospects for the millions of people living outside of big cities? Should we be thinking beyond UAM to rural air mobility — RAM?</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The initial focus of the 100 or more companies working to create eVTOL aircraft and related systems may help solve the pressing urban problems of congestion and gridlock. It’s no surprise that Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are in the thick of this pursuit, as their lives are directly affected by the terrible traffic their mushrooming enterprises help to create.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But there are good reasons to consider applying these technologies to rural America as well, or even first.  Rural residents face a host of logistical issues that have contributed to significant declines in rural population and economic stability in recent decades. If you’re living in a rural area, you’re almost certainly far away from specialized healthcare, let alone a GP. You’re a long way from community colleges and universities; and far from advanced manufacturing jobs, or knowledge-based desk jobs, or even the nearest Costco. Many rural towns are so hard to access, why would anyone want to expand or relocate a business there?</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Already, we see the merits of bringing greater connectivity to rural areas, which is why rural broadband is subsidized to the tune of more than $700 million annually by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Rural air mobility could be part of a new infrastructure plan, should DC mandarins ever create one. The FAA’s Essential Air Service program for small communities, or something like it, could be expanded to include vertiports in towns and on farms or at small manufacturing facilities. RAM operators could receive essential air service subsidies, at least as part of test projects.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">RAM clearly isn’t a panacea for every economic challenge facing rural America, but it may be part of the solution. Indeed, flying these RAM flying taxis around in wide-open areas and small towns may help refine the technologies required for denser airspace.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">One big challenge for urban air vehicles is operating safely over heavily populated areas. They need to pretty reliably not crash. They need complex deconfliction traffic management. They need an infrastructure of lots of landing pads on prime real estate. These challenges, and many others, will need to be addressed before eVTOLs grace urban skylines.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Do these vehicles have the range and payload capacity to fly across vast rural counties and not just across San Francisco Bay? The <a href="https://lilium.com/">Lilium</a> Jet air taxi, according to its designers, will be capable of covering 300 km in 60 minutes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Will we ever get an infrastructure initiative from Washington? Who knows. But if we do, I would advocate for RAM test programs in selected rural areas. And if the government won’t do it, private industry certainly has that capability — and an opportunity to refine valuable technologies in the process.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, the Wright Flyer wasn’t perfected over New York City.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A team of German researchers has created an automatic landing system for small aircraft that lets them touch down not only without a pilot, but without any of the tech on the ground that lets other planes do it. It could open up a new era of autonomous flight — and make ordinary landings safer, to boot.</p>
<p>Now it would be natural to think that with the sophisticated autopilot systems that we have today, a plane could land itself quite easily. And that&#8217;s kind of true — but the autoland systems on full-size aircraft aren&#8217;t really autonomous. They rely on a set of radio signals emitted by stations only found at major airports: the Instrument Landing System, or ILS.</p>
<p>These signals tell the plane exactly where the runway is even in poor visibility, but even so, an &#8220;automatic&#8221; landing is rarely done. Instead, the pilots — as they do elsewhere — use the autopilot system as an assist, in this case to help them locate the runway and descend properly. A plane <em>can</em> land automatically using ILS and other systems, but it&#8217;s rare and, even when they do it, it isn&#8217;t truly autonomous — it&#8217;s more like the airport is flying the plane by wire.</p>
<p>But researchers at Technische Universität München (TUM, or think of it as Munich Tech) have created a system that can land a plane without relying on ground systems at all, and demonstrated it with a pilot on board — or rather, passenger, since he kept his hands in his lap the whole time.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1852570" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1852570" class="breakout wp-image-1852570 size-full" title="tum-plane" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tum-plane.jpg" alt="tum plane" width="1024" height="724" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tum-plane.jpg 1349w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tum-plane.jpg?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tum-plane.jpg?resize=300,212 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tum-plane.jpg?resize=768,543 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tum-plane.jpg?resize=680,481 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tum-plane.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1852570" class="wp-caption-text">The automated plane comes in for a landing</p></div></p>
<p>A plane making an autonomous landing needs to know exactly where the runway is, naturally, but it can&#8217;t rely on GPS — too imprecise — and if it can&#8217;t use ILS and other ground systems, what&#8217;s left? Well, the computer can find the runway the way pilots do: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/13/wtf-is-computer-vision/">with its eyes</a>. In this case, both visible-light and infrared cameras on the nose of the plane.</p>
<p>TUM&#8217;s tests used a single-passenger plane, a Diamond DA42 that the team outfitted with a custom-designed automatic control system and a computer vision processor both built for the purpose, together called C2Land. The computer, trained to recognize and characterize a runway using the cameras, put its know-how to work in May taking the plane in for a flawless landing.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1852564" title="tumlanding" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tumlanding.gif" alt="tumlanding" width="600" height="333" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1852565" title="autotum" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/autotum.gif" alt="autotum" width="600" height="330" /></p>
<p>As test pilot Thomas Wimmer put it in a TUM news release: &#8220;The cameras already recognize the runway at a great distance from the airport. The system then guides the aircraft through the landing approach on a completely automatic basis and lands it precisely on the runway&#8217;s centerline.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can see the full flight in the video below.</p>

<p>This is a major milestone in automated flight, since until now planes have had to rely on extensive ground-based systems to perform a landing like this one — which means automated landings aren&#8217;t currently possible at smaller airports or should something go wrong with the ILS. A small plane like this one is more likely to be at a small airport with no such system, and should a heavy fog roll in, an autoland system like this might be preferable to a pilot who can&#8217;t see in infrared.</p>
<p>Right now the tech is very much still experimental, not even at the level where it could be distributed and tested widely, let alone certified by aviation authorities. But the safety benefits are obvious, and even as a backup or augmentation to the existing, rarely used autoland systems, it would likely be a welcome addition.</p>
